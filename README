UniSIMD-assembler is a low-level macro assembler framework unified across
ARM and x86 architectures. It defines a subset of both core and SIMD
instruction sets in a way that single assembler code would work everywhere.
Initially Intel SSE (1 and 2) and ARM MPE (aka NEON) are primary targets.

The project comes with a test framework which can be compiled in Linux/GCC,
Maemo/scratchbox (ARM version) as well as Windows/VC++ 6.0 or later.
The assembler itself isn't a separate tool, but rather a collection of
header files which can be included directly into any application using it.
