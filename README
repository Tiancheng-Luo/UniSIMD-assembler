UniSIMD assembler is a low-level macro assembler framework unified across
ARM and x86 architectures. It establishes a subset of both core and SIMD
instruction sets with strictly defined common API, so that application logic
can be written and maintained in one place without code replication.
At present, Intel SSE (1 and 2) and ARM MPE (aka NEON) operating in 32-bit mode
are two primary targets, although wider SIMD can be supported by design.

The project comes with a test framework, which can be compiled in Linux/GCC,
Maemo/scratchbox (ARM version) as well as Windows/VC++ 6.0 or later.
The assembler itself isn't a separate tool, but rather a collection of C/C++
header files, that applications need to include directly in order to use.
