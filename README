UniSIMD assembler is a high-level C/C++ macro assembler framework unified across
ARM, MIPS, Power and x86 architectures. It establishes a subset of both BASE and
SIMD instruction sets with clearly defined common API, so that application logic
can be written and maintained in one place without code replication.
The assembler itself isn't a separate tool, but rather a collection of C/C++
header files, which applications need to include directly in order to use.

At present, Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE4 and AVX/AVX2/AVX-512 (32/64-bit x86 ISAs),
ARMv7 NEON/NEONv2, ARMv8:AArch32 NEON and AArch64 NEON (32/64-bit ARM ISAs),
MIPS 32/64-bit r5/r6 MSA and Power 32/64-bit VMX/VSX (little/big-endian ISAs)
are mostly implemented, although scalar SIMD subset, horizontal SIMD reductions,
wider SIMD vectors with zeroing/merging predicates in 3/4-operand instructions,
larger register files and other architectures are planned as future extensions
to current 2-operand (destination-as-1st-source) SPMD-driven vertical SIMD ISA.

All legacy targets support 128-bit SIMD with 8 registers (32-bit elements only).
All modern targets support 256-bit SIMD with 15 registers (using 2x128 on RISC).
Select few targets support 512-bit SIMD with 15 registers (x86, 4x128 on Power).
Heap-address, SIMD-element sizes are 32/64-bit configurable on 64-bit targets.

The project comes with a test framework for Linux/GCC, Windows/VC++/TDM64-GCC.
Instructions for resolving dependencies and building the binaries
for supported platforms can be found in the accompanying INSTALL file.
