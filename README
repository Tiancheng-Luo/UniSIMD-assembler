UniSIMD assembler is a high-level C/C++ macro assembler framework unified across
ARM, MIPS, Power and x86 architectures. It establishes a subset of both BASE and
SIMD instruction sets with clearly defined common API, so that application logic
can be written and maintained in one place without code replication.
The assembler itself isn't a separate tool, but rather a collection of C/C++
header files, which applications need to include directly in order to use.

At present, Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE4 and AVX/AVX2/AVX-512 (32/64-bit x86 ISAs),
ARMv7 NEON/NEONv2, ARMv8:AArch32 NEON and AArch64 NEON (32/64-bit ARM ISAs),
MIPS 32/64-bit r5/r6 MSA and Power 32/64-bit VMX/VSX (little/big-endian ISAs)
are mostly implemented, although scalar SIMD subset, horizontal SIMD reductions,
wider SIMD vectors with zeroing/merging predicates in 3/4-operand instructions,
larger register files and other architectures are planned as future extensions
to current 2-operand (destination-as-1st-source) SPMD-driven vertical SIMD ISA.

The project comes with a test framework for Linux/GCC, Windows/VC++/TDM64-GCC.
Instructions for resolving dependencies and building the binaries
for supported platforms can be found in the accompanying INSTALL file.

UniSIMD core features:
 - Unified, Universal, Portable, Compatible code
 - Explicit register-allocation, predictable performance
 - Three register-categories for code: 8, 16, 32 (8, 15, 30)
 - High-level SIMD registers/ops as singles, pairs or quads
 - SIMD-aligned backend structures with offsets/factors
 - Vector-length agnostic vertical SIMD ISA, configurable
 - Simultaneous scalar+128/256-bit+configurable SIMD
 - ISA reservation for fp16/fp128 (half/quad) SIMD ops
 - C/C++, Compute, SPMD on 4 major archs
 - Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE4 and AVX/AVX2/AVX-512
 - ARM NEON, ARMv8 AArch32, AArch64 NEON
 - MIPS r5/r6 MSA (Warrior P5600, I6400/P6600)
 - Power VMX/VSX (PowerPC G4, POWER7/8)
 - CISC, RISC, CISC on RISC, little/big-endian ISA
 - FMA3 support (native or higher-precision emulation)
 - 32/64-bit hybrid mode for native 64-bit ABI
 - 32/64-bit addressing for BASE and SIMD ops
 - 32/64-bit configurable SIMD elements (fp+int)
 - Simultaneous 32/64-bit BASE (with rules) and SIMD
 - ISA reservation for int8/int16 (byte/half) BASE ops
 - Full code-control, compiler steps out of the way
 - Potential for bit-exact fp-compute across targets
 - Used in QuadRay engine
