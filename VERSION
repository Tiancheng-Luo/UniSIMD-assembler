v0.6: Unified SIMD Assembler, additional SIMD targets
  - add new SIMD targets for SSE1, AVX1, AVX2
  - add shifts by fixed core register instructions
  - add float-to-integer convert with mode parameter (x86, ARM + A32)
  - add signed-integer divide for ARM's A32 mode
  - remap SIMD registers for ARM to avoid collision with div VFP fallback
  - additional SIMD tests, run level 15

v0.5: Unified SIMD Assembler, API freeze for the engine
  - instructions naming scheme finalized
  - change ARM instructions to set flags
  - added framework for internal constants (used by reciprocals)
  - added SIMD instruction for cube root, reciprocal steps redesigned
  - additional SIMD tests, run level 14

v0.4: SIMD test framework, macro assembler overhaul
  - macro expansion reworked for better compiler compatibility
  - immediate/displacement parameters handling redesigned
  - added reciprocal support for SSE, MPE support refined

v0.3: SIMD test framework, run level 9
  - tests for integer mul, div, jmp instructions
  - SIMD tests for integer add, shl, shr instructions
  - SIMD tests for cvt, sqr, rsq instructions

v0.2: SIMD test framework, run level 5
  - SIMD tests for mul, div, cmp instructions

v0.1: SIMD test framework, run level 1
  - SIMD tests for add, sub instructions
