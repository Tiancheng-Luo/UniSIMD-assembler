To build SIMD test framework on Linux, open terminal window,
go to the project's root folder, then "test" subfolder,
make sure necessary tools and libraries are installed
for 32-bit systems:
    sudo apt-get install make g++
for 64-bit systems:
    sudo apt-get install make g++-multilib
run for x86 architecture:
    make -f simd_make_x86.mk
    ./simd_test.x86
run for non-x86 architectures:
    make -f simd_make_***.mk
    ./simd_test.***
Prerequisites for building/emulating guest non-x86 architectures as well as
configurations for particular hardware platforms are given in the makefiles.
Only DEB-based distributions (Mint, Ubuntu, Debian) are supported for now,
users of RPM-based distributions need to figure out build-deps on their own.

To build SIMD test framework on Windows,
go to the project's root folder, then "test" subfolder and open:
    simd_workspace.dsw
in Visual C++ 6.0 or later, then press F5. In newer versions of VC++ agree to
convert workspace files, then exit and open newly created solution file.
